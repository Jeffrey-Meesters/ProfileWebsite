# ProfileWebsite
My profile website [(not so much anymore) Work In Progress]
---

## Goal of this project
The goal of this project is to show that I know how to use JS (JQuery), CSS and HTML5.
And with that make a responsive webdesign. So it's not so much about to content itself (strange hu, for a profile website!).
That is also why I sometimes have chosen to use JS over CSS, while CSS would've been the easier solution.

Am I hapy with the content? Not so.
will I change it? Probably in the near future, but now I need to go and focus on other coding stuff.
What coding stuff? Finish up the Store project, find a jr. webdevelopers job, Java?, React?, Angular?, PHP? more Ruby?

Also if you are here because my profile page brought you so, please feel free to contact me about job positions.
I'm looking for one!
