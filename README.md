# ProfileWebsite
My profile website [Work In Progress]

I changed my website to make it responsive.
You can find it in the "responsive" branch.
It is not merged with Master, because atm it is in its mobile first state (tested/made it on my Huawei p9 lite).
As soon as the website is fully responsive (or when I find it responsive enough) I will update everything.

###The version you can visit online is not responsive.
