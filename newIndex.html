      <p>Hi!
        <br>
        <a href="#">I'm Jeffrey</a>. Currently available for job-openings in ICT.
        I've been re-schooled to webdeveloper by Codaisseur and graduated last December.
      </p>

      <p>
        Before I started my re-schooling with Codaisseur I was working for the Rabobank for 2 years.
        First as Commercial Assistant Small Businesses and soon after became Commercial Advisor Small Businesses.
        I Chose to work here as initually I graduated as Financial Advisor from the University of Amsterdam (HvA) in 2013.
      </p>

      <p>
        While working for the Rabobank my attention got more and more drawn to creating websites and so I started creating simple ones.
        I only used HTML and CSS, nothing fancy. As it became clear that the financial companies are increasingly automating
        their interaction with the client, and therefore where reorganizing, I was looking for a way out. I found out about Codaisseur
        and decided to commit myself to become a developer.

      Codaisseur offers a graduate program that enabled me, within a short period of time, to learn what it means to be a webdeveloper.
      The graduate program is very intensive. Weeks of 70 hours and longer are no exception and the subject matter is diverse and extensive.
      </p>
      <p>
      Subjects:
      The traineeship has the following topics: <em> Ruby, RSpec, Rails, JS / Node (incl. ES6), Mocha, Chai, React, Redux, SQL, HTML5, and CSS3 </em>.
      In addition, the following aspects of development are also discussed: <em> Create reviews and quality assessments,
      TDD, the basis of product development, UX design, domain modeling </em>
      and of course <em> teamwork </em> using tools like <em> Atom, git, Github, CI and Slack</em>.

        When re-schooling with Codaisseur we did a lot of projects.
        Also after I was done I kept coding and started own projects.
        I'd like to showcase a <u>few</u> of them here.

              This one was quit hard.
              It is a two-player reaction game based on:
              Feathers, React, Redux and MongoDb.
              Focus: Mainly getting the React part to work as a lot of back-end was already provided (and live-coded) by Codaisseur.

              During Codaisseurs' internship.
